# Transformer-Based Legal Document Intelligence for Compliance

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and documentation for a **research project** focused on leveraging transformer-based models to streamline legal document analysis and automate compliance reviews.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the application of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques — specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER) and summarization — to assist in understanding lengthy legal documents and extracting compliance-relevant information.

### 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using a BERT-based approach to extract legal and regulatory entities from complex texts.
- **Summarization** using an FLAN-T5 model to generate concise, human-readable summaries of verbose legal content.
- Developed an end-to-end pipeline to automate document understanding and accelerate compliance checks.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- `NER_BERT_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the NER model.
- `FLAN_T5.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating summarization of legal documents.
